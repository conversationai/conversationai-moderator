"1. Starchild is an alien or alien / human hybrid.
2. Starchild is a human with a disease or condition never seen before.
3. Starchild is a human who was from the Atlantis civilization.
2. and 3. would be likely if it is determined that Starchild has 46 chromosomes and a Y chromosome. In this case, the Y chromosome haplogroup must be determined.
1. is likely based on anatomical examination because of unerupted multiple teeth and strange fibers as seen from X ray analysis and electron microscopes, bone chemical composition markedly different from normal human bone composition, inability to dissolve in solution which easily dissolves human bone, wear of the teeth suggesting Starchild was not a child but a grown person, lack of anatomical features such as frontal sinuses."

""Until its      modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in oriental cultures, uninvented in the pre-Columbian Americas, and of only limited use in sub-mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in Europe and areas influenced strongly by its cultures.""
Perhaps some mention should be made of paneer, the ubiquitous Indian fresh cheese, which does not owe its existence to European culture, but rather is apparently of Persian origin.

This argument is ridiculous. The opinion of some Calvinists that the Roman Catholic Church is not ""Catholic"" in the ""strict sense of the word"" is irrelevant to an article that is intended to be neutral. For the purpose of a neutral article each group should be referred to by the name which they give themselves; to do otherwise is to take a position regarding the truth or falsity of the claims. Therefore, I am going to change ""Papist
to ""Roman Catholic"" each time it appears in this article other than in direct quotes."

Consider for a moment the gender roles that best suit the parent philosophies of PanDeism. First you have Deism - this is absolutely a masculine concept. God is a father-figure, not a mother giving birth to the universe, but a mechanic, an architect, a craftsman, a clockmaker, a typical male role. And what does this father do after the universe has been made and set in motion, when the gears are wound? He abandons us. He disappears, and does not make himself available to us. We trust that he is still there, but can only confirm this through the exercise of cold reason; this is a God who is cold, emotionless, out of reach, like every stoic father who has presented only this face to a son, a tradition passed down from generations before. The God of Deism therefore possesses the attributes of the Yang.
Now you have PanTheism - a feminine concept if ever one was! God is the universe that envelops us, is all around us, wraps us in her warmth. God is ever present, sharing herself completely with us, giving us unconditional love because we are part of her, born from her womb with an umbilical cord that can never be severed. This is the ultimate mother, the ultimate feminine, possessing the attribute of the Yin.
Hence, PanDeism strikes the perfect balance of masculinity and femininity, of Yin and Yang (thus not surprisingly, PanDeistic ideologies are far more prevalent in Asia). Like the masculine Deist God, the PanDeist god is a mechanic, an architect, a clockmaker; but the PanDeist God does not abandon us when his act of creation is completed; rather, the PanDeist God assumes the other role, that of the PanTheist all enveloping mother, allowing us to exist through her very substance
So, as Deism and PanTheism combine to find the perfect balance in PanDeism, so must we strive to find this balance in ourselves and in our relationships, to both build and nurture, to be sufficiently distant yet always present when this presence is called for. We are each a microcosm of the potential balance of the universe, and each of us already carries with us the connection with the universe that enables us to emulate its temperment, should we desire to touch the God within ourselves. Realize, therefore, beloved friends, that touching God therefore means touching the characteristics within ourselves that reflect the opposite gender - men must find their feminine side, and women their masculine."

::You may beleive it is an reasonable statement and argument, but it is based on your opinion not on reason nor logic. Take my example, do you think ""The communist party does not say the moon is made of cheese in every day news"" is a reasonable and logical argument that ""the moon is not made of cheese""? Here's another example: is ""The communist party does not say 2+2=5 in every day news"" a reasonable and logical argument that ""2 add 2 does not equal 5""? I'm not sure what the technical term is for this but it comes under something like spurious argument or false reasoning."

I took the liberty of reorganizing this article by subdividing the ""Prairie Saints"" and ""Rocky Mountain Saints"" sections into subsections based upon the provenances of the various organizations (back to one of the original sects that arose during the ""Succession Crisis"" of 1844).  I felt that subdividing these lengthy sections would do more toward helping readers understand each group of sects and where they ""fit"" in the overall Restoration Movement picture.
I tried to do my best in classifying each sect as ""Brighamite,"" ""Josephite,"" ""Strangite,"" etc., but anyone disagreeing please feel free to move the sect in question appropriately.  I also eliminated the ""Other groups"" section by folding its contents into appropriate subsctions of the ""Prairie Saints"" or ""Rocky Mountain"" sections, as each of those churches could legitimately fit in one of those subsections (confusing, isn't it!!).
One word more: usage of ""Brighamite,"" ""Josephite,"" etc. is strictly for convenience; no derogation or other insult is intended by my use of these terms. -"

Removed the ""dog-tag"" reference - unnecessary; trite. It is now an external link. Should this even be here?
Moved ""controversial"" remark to end of paragraph, referenced cited article. Should this even be here?
Formatted the second stanza (Warrior Ethos) in similar fashion to the way it is primarily displayed.
Added merged ""Warrior Ethos"" copy.
Added a reference to age of previous version.

Reading the article, it is stated that the Carver does not have any genitalia, however by my understanding of sexual development in humans, this isn't particularly possible.  The most common results are a vagina, or penis/testicles, however intersexed conditions only develop in a range of variation between a vagina and penis/testicles.  To say that the Carver has no genitalia at all is highly suspicious, what evidence is shown on the show to indicate this?  Is there a graphic of Costa demonstrating no genitalia at all, or he simply described as having no genitalia.  Likely in the later case, they would mean that he is absent a penis in order to perform the rapes, but not entirely absent of genitalia.  (However, this wouldn't be the first time that Nip/Tuck has made errors about intersex/transgender/transsexual people.  In the first season there is an episode about transsexuals, although all of the people depicted are cross-dressers, and have a significantly more masculine appearance than most all actual transsexuals.)"

::Agreed a source is needed, but this sounds like just the basic view of vajrayana buddhism to me and not particularly controversial aside from the military language. Though it's a little off, because once one realizes the vajra body one also realizes the inseparability of all beings. So not so much that they possess the same essence (that idea of possession implies truly established existence) but more that one realizes buddha nature was all there really was to begin with. Something like that. -"

:The problem with saying that the icon collage doesn't have to all inclusive is that the scope of this project is all inclusive. I personally don't see a picture of a sunset as a sun worshiping symbol, but you object to it on those grounds. You're saying that I'm fabricating a controversy (even though if you would read the history of the banner and some of the other activities of this project, you'd see that it's not fabricated at all), and I could say the same of you - that you're fabricating a controversy over an innocent photograph of a landscape. On the other hand, you want folks who would object to seeing a religious icon on their page that they object to, or not see their own icon on their page because their religion isn't deemed important or widespread enough to just accept that the graphic that we pick is good enough. My vote is for the project not to have a graphic at all - graphics are superfluous and certainly not mandatory for a project."

"The parliamentary section has been amended and a bit now reads:
""Two years later, in 1888, he secured passage of a new Oaths Act, which enshrined into law the right of affirmation for members of both Houses, as well as for witnesses in civil and criminal trials.""
I'm almost entirely certain that this is misleading, but I've not changed it because I want to check.  There was in fact an earlier act (1869?) allowing atheists to give evidence in court, and it was to that Bradlaugh appealed when first asking to be allowed to affirm (the request denied, of course).  His 1888 act may have consolidated all the legislation but it didn't originate the right to affirmation in court, just for parliament. ~~"

I assure you I am not being paid by anybody to contribute to Wikipedia, I do not support George Bush or Tony Blair and I do not see how Hitler can possible be 'close too centre wing'. Wikipedias definition of far right:
In the modern world, the term far right is applied to those who support authoritarianism, usually involving a dominant class (which may be aristocratic or defined along racial or other lines), and/or an established church . Their favored authoritarian state can be an absolute monarchy, but more often today it is some form of oligarchy or military dictatorship. This is most true in regions and nations that have no real history of monarchy, such as Central America (discounting the Pre-Columbian era), Switzerland, and the United States. The term ""far right"" also embraces extreme nationalism, and will often evoke the ideal of a ""pure"" ideal of the nation, often defined on racial or ""blood"" grounds. They may advocate the expansion or restructuring of existing state borders to achieve this ideal nation, often to the point of embracing expansionary war, racialism, jingoism and imperialism.
Hitler was nationalst, embraced expansionary war, a radical, imperialst, authoritarian and supported an established church all of which are traits of the far right. Bush is nothing more than an idiot and Blair is failing to take tough  enough action on the EU, immigration and a whole host of other issues. I will see what i come up as on the Political Spectrum test."

In 1475, the Swiss invaded the Barony of Vaud and took the castle of Grandson from Jacques de Savoie, the count of Romont and Lord of Vaud. Charles the Bold, an ally of Jacques de Savoie, besieged the castle of Grandson in 1476. The Swiss defenders, believing that they would be spared if they surrendered, surrendered. However, Charles the Bold believed the Swiss threw themselves on his mercy and he executed all 412 Swiss by hanging and drowning. At the Battle of Grandson, a Swiss relief force arriving too late to lift the siege, defeated Charles the Bold and annexed Grandson and its surrounding area to Bern.

Some questions about this article.
1. The statement that Chilvers invented the Windsurfer is like stating that someone invented the Xerox, or the Kleenex. Just as Xerox and Kleenex are trademarked terms which have come into common use, the term Windsurfer was a trademark of Windsurfing International, Hoyle Schweitzer's company. This is clearly demonstrated in records of the US Patent and Trademark office, which shows the registration date as July 3, 1973 . Courts also recognized that the Chilvers invention was different in design from the Schweitzer Windsurfer . Therefore it would seem more accurate, using a generic term, to state that Chilvers invented the sailboard. If there is any evidence or record that Chilvers named his invention a ""windsurfer,"" prior to 1972 when the Schweitzer trademark registration was filed, this would be relevant.
2. According to the Bicsport website, Tabur was a pre-existing French boat-building company acquired by Baron Bic in the late seventies. It introduced its first boat in 1968 . In light of this, the claim that Chilvers was the founder of Tabur Marine is puzzling. Is there any info available to clear the link between Chilvers and Tabur?"

In the European Virtual Console some but not all games are available in the languages they were originally published in.
Some games are multilingual (as they were in their original form, example: Super Mario 64), others are avaiable in mutliple versions (example: The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past). The Wii's country setting decides which version will be available for download. If a user wants to download more than one version, he is charged once per version.
An example for a game not available in all of its original language choices is Kirby's Adventure. The NES game was published in a fully localized version in Germany, but only the English version has been made avaiable for users connecting to the Wii Shop Channel, with a German country setting, in time of the game's Virtual Console release."

Hello Fainites. If you have anything specific that you wish me to doublecheck, then post it on my talkpage and I will see if I can.  But I do believe that with so many anonymous and odd edits going undiscussed on the NLP article, even verbatim quotes will be misplaced. It does seem to me that the anonymous editors are sockpuppets of Comaze. I would rather edit other articles where this problem is not occurring.
Hi again Fainites. Here is the quote in full from Sharpley 87:
The most conclusive sentence (about conclusions) in that section you presented is that “There are conclusive data from the research on NLP, and the conclusion is that the principles and procedures of NLP have failed to be supported by those data”
Then he says “On the other hand, Einspruch and Forman (1985) implied that NLP is far more complex than presumed by researchers, and thus, the data are not true evaluations of NLP. Perhaps this is so, and perhaps NLP procedures are not amenable to research evaluation. This does not necessarily reduce NLP to worthlessness for counseling practice. Rather it puts it in the same category as psychoanalysis, that is, with principles not easily demonstrated in laboratory settings but, nevertheless, strongly supported by clinicians in the field. Not every therapy has to undergo the rigorous testing that is characteristic of the more behavioural approaches to counseling to be of use to the therapeutic community, but failure to produce data that support a particular theory from controlled studies does relegate that theory to questionable status in terms of professional accountability”
Right at the end of the article the sentences read:
“Elich et al referred to NLP as a psychological fad, and they may well have been correct. Certainly research data do not support the rather extreme claims that proponents of NLP have made as to the validity of its principles or the novelty of its procedures.”
I think the only thing to do with this is rely on what the other researchers (eg Devilly, Eisner and so on) say about Sharpley. Also, if NLP is actually mentioned in the Norcross research that AB presented then that may help as it is even more recent regarding acceptance by clinicians."

OMG SHUT UP U STOOPID"
"I think the whole Andromeda Paradox is incredibly misleadingly described. If two people are standing in the street, and one person starts walking away from the other, then he absolutely will not view events in the Andromeda galaxy which are two days apart. That's a nonsense. As an example, let's imagine you are viewing a supernova through your telescope. If you decide to move your telescope to the left by a couple of foot you don't suddenly see the supernova as it existed two days ago - before it exploded. Move your telescope - the supernova explodes; stop moving your telescope - the supernova doesn't explode. Obviously not the case.
:The paradox is about what events observers consider to be on their x-axes, no-one can observe such events, they can only observe things transmitted from the events like light. This does not mean that the events on the x-axes do not happen and, if you use SR to allow for the transmission of light and the effects of relative velocities you get the Andromeda paradox. (ie: Penrose is not stupid!).
If that was that case then the speed of rotation of Earth would dominate any relative velocity difference of two people walking in the street - people on one side of Earth would see the supernova exploding, while people on the other side of Earth would see the supernova two days earlier before it exploded. We'd see total confusion in space! Roger Penrose actually describes it misleadingly in his original description in his book: ""Even with quite slow relative velocities, significant differences in time-ordering will occur for events at great distances"" - well, that's absolutely not the case if the two observers are not spatially separated (see my earlier example about viewing a supernova).
:The paradox is about what events observers consider to be on their x-axes at any instant, not about the order in which photons are received. Penrose is not stupid.
::But the order in which photons are received defines what events the observers consider to be simultaneous. Remember the old special relativity thought experiment of an observer in a moving train sending two light pulses out to the back and the front of the train? He says the rays arrive simultaneously precisely because he sees the photons arrive at the same time (of course, it's not just limited to light - the speed of light provides an upper limit for any information). It's that speed of light which defines that x-axis to which you refer. I know Penrose is not stupid, but this Andromeda Paradox makes the mistake of overestimating the effect of special relativity on two walking observers. As I say, the rotation of the planet would have a far greater effect than any walking velocity! Penrose has made a mistake here.
:::The debate is about the geometrical rather than the dynamical interpretation of SR. Both observers get the light arriving in the right order and the car receives the same light signals as the man on the street while they coincide.  The issue is a philosophical enquiry into the nature of the geometrical interpretation of SR - if the world is a (3+1)D manifold then, although the x axes of the man and the car coincide where they meet they diverge with distance by  seconds with distance along the man's x axis.  The x-axis is on the hyperplane of things that are simultaneously present so, according to the geometrical interpretation, the car has different events on Andromeda in its present moment from those on Andromeda in the man's present moment.
If two people in the street are not spatially separated then they WILL agree about simultaneity (though one might experience time dilation - his clock might be running slower). And if the two observers are not spatially separated AND their relative velocities are small then there will be absolutely NO difference of opinion about simultaneity - in the Andromeda galaxy on anywhere else - OR time dilation. Basically, their experiences will be identical. I think the whole presentation of this ""paradox"" is desperately flawed and is misleading and basically incorrect in its current form as presented here. The only way that small relative velocities would have an impact (as suggested by Roger Penrose) is if the two observers are also separated by a great distance (i.e., the combination of small relative velocity IN COMBINATION with a long time for light to reach the observers from a distant galaxy has resulted in the observers being far apart when the two signals reach them - so they disagree about simultaneity - this agrees with the comments of Pgb23 above: ""In actual fact the car would have to have been travelling for as long as the light signal from Andromeda ... It would be no good briefly increasing one’s speed.""). The Rietdijk-Putnam argument is fascinating and fundamental, but - with the greatest respect for Roger Penrose - the ""Andromeda Paradox"" is just plain misleading in this form and should be rewitten or (preferably) deleted.

Article says France and the United Kingdom were the only countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships, although several other navies made use of a mixture of screw battleships and paddle-steamer frigates. These included Russia, Turkey, Sweden, Naples, Prussia, Denmark and Austria.
I don't follow: britain and france were the only countries with wooden steam screw battleships. But then it says several others had screw battleships. Is that screw metal battleships, which seems redundant because lots of people had this? Or screw wood but also paddle and wood, which is worth making as a distinction because some of their ships had paddles? This is a complicated way of saying it seems to say only britain had screw wood ships, but some others had screw wood ships. Britain never had a fleet exclusively screw wood."

A caution for the current wave of ""succession planinng"" panic setting in because government and business is facing the challenge of how many ""baby boomers"" might leave their employment soon.  Traditional succession planning has focused on charts with names of potential temporary or permanent successors for a key vacancy.  This is good thinking for the most part.  However, it
is not as robust an investment as a progressive 21st Century enterprise should be making.  ""Leadership succession,"" a more
recent evolution of traditional succession planning, focuses on an enterprise-wide development of leaders at all levels so that
the organization can be confident a ready pool of talent is being readied to compete for positions that might come open.
Rather than focusing only on ""replacement"" (succession) and targeting a limited one or two names, leadership succession invites many to identify their interest in possible moving up and become involved in leadership development to prepare.  This process is more inclusive (read fair) and if done right becomes an accelerator for organizational success.

Looks like I'll need to refer to those resources a few more times.  The one thing that jumped out at me (at the moment), is the majority/minority view discussion.  In the current section, I would interpret that the conflict with milbloggers has had a major impact on the perception of his credibility and hence his readership.  The milbloggers had previous helped build his prestige and it was the conflict with them that then diminished it.  Conversely, he does still maintain very loyal fans. Looking at it from the outside in, it would appear to me that the views are probably equally divided and ardently argued by the two sides, with few in the middle. In short, he has become a very polarizing figure in the period since he took on BG Menard.

Right then, I'd like to start with some boring little bibliographical questions about the article on Štreit. (For which I thank you. I don't know his work, but a good rule of thumb is that anything exhibited by Amber/Side is worthwhile. I'll investigate.) The questions are very simple, really, but unfortunately in order to ask them I have to use a lot of bytes.
Worldcat tells me of Josef Moucha, Helena Musilová, and Eva Marlene Hodek, Fotogenie identity: pamět̕ české fotografie / The photogeny of identity: The memory of Czech photography (Prague: Pražský dům fotografie, 2006; ISBN 8086970124).
(It may be better to say that Moucha, Musilová, and Hodek are the editors, or that all are contributors but that Moucha is the editor. I can't read Czech so I'm guessing.)
Surely ""Prague House of Photography"" is the name in English of Pražský dům fotografie; let's not quibble about which to use. And perhaps Kant is publishing it on behalf of Pdf, just as (for example) Yale University Press publishes books on behalf of the photo museum at Houston.
However, the article seems to imply that this book is ""in: Dufek, Antonín: Vesnice je svět (The Village is a Global World), Prague, Arcadia 2003. Preface.""
I guess you mean that what Dufek is quoted as saying is from Dufek's preface to his own Vesnice je svět, via Fotogenie identity: pamět̕ české fotografie. Is this right? If so, perhaps:
:. . . ; quoting Antonín Dufek's preface to his Vesnice je svět (The Village is a Global World; Prague, Arcadia 2003; ISBN _______)
or of course the other way around:
:Antonín Dufek, preface to his Vesnice je svět (The Village is a Global World; Prague, Arcadia 2003; ISBN _______); quoted in . . .
I looked in WorldCat for this book but couldn't find it. However, I was able to find this quadrilingual book by Štreit (photos) and Dufek (text): Vesnice je svět / The Village is a Global World / Das Dorf ist eine globale Welt / Un village, c'est tout un monde (Prague: Arcadia, 1993; ISBN 8090142354). Perhaps the 2003 book is a new edition or just a reprinting of this.
In the list of references, why ""coll.""? Is this something like ""collective authorship""? If so, sorry but I don't think that this abbreviation is commonly used or much understood in English. (If a book has many authors, of course it's fine to name the first one and say ""et al."" for the rest.)
Excuse the boringness of my questions. More importantly, I'm glad that you wrote an article on Štreit and I look forward to looking at his work. (More on Tichý and others a bit later.)"

Well I was impressed anyway. ;-) Less impressed though by yet another demonstration that administrators (Tom) are not held to the same standards they so frequently demand of their underlings.

Thank You for answering my questions.  I really appreciate it.  I am still not really sure why ISKCON must be considered Hindu, yet ISKCON views cannot be considered in Hindu articles.  Seems kind of hypocritical. Another thing is that Prabhuphada's Bhagavad-Gita is the most widely read and also He states it is the only pure translation.  But anyways, if Krishna Conciousness differs from Hinduism, why can't I create articles like Krishna Conscious Cosmology, or Krishna in Krishna Consciousness, or Rama in Krishna Consciousness ect.  I have tried doing this in the past because even though Wikipedia considers ISKCON Hindu they do not allow ISKCON's views in Hindu articles.  I find this hypocritical but I gave up trying to fight it so I made my own articles like Krishna in Krishna Conciousness, or Rama in Krishna Consciousness so I could just present the Krishna Conscious view.  I cited many reliable Krishna Conscious sources on the Krishna Conscious view but my articles were deleted over and over until they banned me.  I don't understand why I got banned.  Isn't it fair that if other religions can have their own views on things like Cosmology, such as Biblical Cosmology, Hindu Cosmology, Buddhist Cosmology, and Jain Cosmology that Krishna Consciousness also have a page Krishna Conscious Cosmology to express its unique view if it is not allowed on Hindu Cosmology?  Another thing about the Naraka (Hinduism) is that I know there is a Naraka page, but a few days ago I saw the Naraka (Buddhism) page and I liked it and from reading the Shrimad-Bhagavatam it seemed sort of familiar to me.  I liked how it talked about all the different Hells one by one giving good description, so I went to see if Hinduism had something like that which talked about all the diferent Hellish planets like Buddhism. but an article did not exist so I spent a few hours to make one.  If this is not okay because ISKCON has ""Non-Hindu"" beleifs can I make an article entitled Naraka (Krishna Consciousness) so that the beliefs of my religion can be expressed like the beliefs of all the other religions? Sorry for asking so many questions.  Thank You very much for answering all of my questions and for your cooperation, time, and effort."
