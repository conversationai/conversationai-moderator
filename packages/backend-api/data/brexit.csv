It's rubbish,0.69
They are ignorant,0.63
Fools,0.62
Daft buggers,0.50
Hate it. Didn't vote for it.,0.49
I think they are wrong to think that Britain cant survive without the EU. I think they are cowards.,0.48
Dreadful: I'm a Remainer,0.41
"Disagreed, especially because of the amount of xenophobia and racism",0.38
left wing wimps,0.38
It is a horrible decision that will affect generations negatively across Europe.,0.28
"I'm broadly in agreement with them, I think they're naive about power sharing in Europe. I resent the idea that pro- Brexiters are racist or anti-immigration",0.24
This country is a mess we need to do something to change it. They can think what they like but we voted to leave so man up and deal with it.,0.23
"They are entitled to their opinions by and large, but I am uneasy and disagree with xenophobic, racist or uninformed views.",0.21
They look at life through rose coloured glasses. They lack a sense of reality and grounded attitude. Lack vision and understanding the big picture.,0.21
Ambivalent. On one hand huge europhile. On other hand I think EU has lost its way,0.20
"People can believe what they want to believe, however I do not appreciate being called a racist for voting leave. There are other reasons people voted leave.",0.19
I voted Brexit as a protest vote. I didn't think 'we' would win because the Remainers were too confident/bone idle. The resulting displays of xenophobia and race hate appal me as I am the daughter of an economic migrant myself.,0.16
I feel sad that people are so disenfranchised that they feel this decision was their only option,0.13
I am against Brexit and think it is divisive. I was shocked and upset at the result,0.13
"I have changed my own personal opinion, I voted remain and was initially angry about the decision and thought it was made of ignorance , the behaviour of other remain voters since has changed my mind",0.13
I am devastated and feel like we are in the brink of disaster,0.12
"Democracy, people have spoken. People want jobs and we're fed up of money being sent to EU that could fund NHS and education etc",0.11
Will be bad for the country. The economy will suffer. The leave campaign made clearly misleading claims,0.11
The people have spoken and the government have a mandate to trigger article 50. We are strong enough to make this work in the countries and British people's I retest.,0.09
I voted for it. Hope we get it. I like a change and a challenge and think something needed to be changed. Break eggs to make an omelette and all that!,0.09
"I welcome other people's viewpoints. I don't think anyone really knows if Brexit will be a good of bad thing, all we have are opinions, so no point judging others for theirs! I don't believe Brexit is a moral issue so no point in judging!",0.08
Sadly a result of abandonment by politicians of the people they are meant to serveThe majority decided and that should be honoured.,0.06
"It's going to be interesting but probably not all bad. People have been so polarized that we miss discussing some key points that are obviously a concern for many people i.e. immigration = racism, but that means there is no debate about what people could be worried about, like finite resource issues such as schools or the NHS. That's not helpful in being able to understand the opposing point of view.",0.06
"Ambivalent at the moment. Its a hot topic which , naturally, generates a lot of unsubstantiated ""hysteria"" in my book. However, I'm taking it all in and will possibly have an opinion when the seas have calmed somewhat.",0.06
"It is a pity that the country is divided. There are good and bad aspects of the EU. Overall, the EC, EEC before it morphed into the EU was ok. It was reasonable. The EU is currently not reasonable in its outlook and decision making. The accountability of the EU is deplorable. It will fail. However, there is hope - maybe a reasonable, evolved European co-operative structure will develop. I hope that the people who disagree with Brexit think. Be critical of the EU. Britain and her citizens deserve the best - the EU is not that going to give Britain and the European nations.",0.06
I am happy with the democratic decision. I was unhappy with the UK following rules dictated by other countries' MEPs I had no part in electing.,0.06
"Disappointed in the vote, and very concerned about what this means for European unity in the future, but understand why voters chose Brexit and respect the vote of the majority. Nevertheless, there was far too much disinformation circulating and obtuse campaigning by both Remain and Brexit supporters to make a reasoned, well informed decision.",0.05
"I want our parliament to be sovereign, I don't trust other nations to have our best interests at heart",0.04
"I did not want to leave the EU, and find the prospect of Brexit quite scary in relation to security, our position in the world, our relationship with Ireland and with trade.",0.04
It's a bad idea. We should have stayed in the EU. We are better protected in a European group. We help other countries and be helped by them. Staying in Europe would have been better for our future generations,0.04
I wonder whether they fully appreciate what we gain from membership. They seem to be worried about over regulation and immigration.,0.03
They think it is cut and dried positive and they don't seem to understand the complexities and potential impacts,0.03
It ain't broke let's not fix it,0.03
"That they are entitled to their opinion, as I am to mine, but we might not be in such disagreement if there had been more reliable information disseminated, more rational discussion about the pros and cons of Brexit vs Remain and less manipulation by politicians.",0.03
They are only thinking of their own benefit.,0.03
"I thought it was a good idea, but like everything else in politics, all is not what it seems and it won't be what the public thought it would be.",0.03
It can be a positive thing for the country. A decision has been made. People have to deal with it and move on.,0.02
"I am pleased about it, being a Brit. I believe all nations should have complete autonomy. within reason.",0.02
Whether I agree or not democracy has spoken so as a country we have to do whatever is best.,0.02
I voted to remain as I think that we are stronger in Europe and I don't think that the Government has the ability to negotiate a good deal for us. I also enjoy the multicultural society in London and think that we should welcome immigrants.,0.02
Oh dear what have we done,0.02
"I don't want Britain to leave the EU, and I recognise that we can learn from our neighbours. The European parliament clearly has issues with corporate governance, but I think it would have been better to try to address these than to start the exit process. However, what's done is done, what will be will be, and I hope things turn out well.",0.02
It was really hard to find honest information to make a decision. I'm not surprised people came to a different conclusion.,0.02
People didn't fully appreciate what they were voting for and the outcome.,0.02
We should remain in the EU and reform from within.,0.02
I voted remain,0.02
"I disagree with the vote and the sentiment, but believe it presents an opportunity for the UK.",0.01
I don't think it is a good idea I like being part of the EU and I think we're stronger as a whole.,0.01
"It will be good for the UK overall, although it might cause financial concern in the short term",0.01
I think that the decision has been made and we should unite to make it happen. However I am worried for the future and uncertainty.,0.01
