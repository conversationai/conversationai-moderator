# The Data Model for Osmod

## Connecting to remote SQL Google Cloud database

From [a cloud shell in your project](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/), you can run:

`gcloud beta sql connect <instance-name> --user=<username>`

To connect to your SQL instance. You'll need to create the username from the
[google cloud SQL config interface](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/sql/instances/osmod-development-branch/users).

### User

Users are users of Osmod. This is the moderation team, and people who admin the
Osmod system using the UI.

- id (int) (required)

Service users serve 2 purposes:
- They are used to authenticate non-humans that want to access to the system.  Use the [get-token](../README.md#the-osmod-cli) CLI command to create a suitable JWT token for this purpose.
- They are used to store the configuration for a moderator endpoint.

For the latter, the required configuration is stored in the extra field in a JSON blob that looks like

```json
{
  serviceType: 'moderator',
  endpointType: 'perspective-proxy' || 'perspective-api',
  endpoint: <URL of endpoint>,
  extra: <Any extra configuration required by this endpoint.>
}
```

## Mappings

### YouTube

For YouTube we use the following map:

* YouTube Channel -> OSMod Category
* YouTube Video -> OSMod Article
* YouTube Comment ->  OSMod Comment

YouTube allows comments on the channel as well as the Video.  To accommodate this, there is a special article that corresponds to the channel itself, labelled "Channel comments."

You can connect multiple YouTube accounts to a single OSMod instance.  Each connection has an associated user of type "youtube" that stores the necessary authentication credentials.
We set the ownerID field of each category/article/comment fetched from YouTube to point to the YouTube user that is responsible for this entity.
